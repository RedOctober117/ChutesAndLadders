# Game Components
- 8x8 Grid numbered from 1-64 from bottom left to top right
- 4 game piece tokens
- 1 die, 2 for faster games

# Game Flow
- Each player starts on square 1.
- Player 1 rolls a die to determine the number of spaces to move. 
	- If a player rolls a 6, they roll again _after_ moving.
- If a player lands at the foot of a ladder, they move to the top of the ladder. 
- If a player lands at the top of a chute, they move to the foot of the chute.
- Repeat for each player
# Win Condition
The first player to reach the last square wins.
## Variations
- A player must roll the exact amount of spaces to reach the last square, or they lose their turn.
- A player must roll the exact amount of spaces to reach the last square. If they roll a larger number, they move to the end square and back again. For example, if a player requires a _3_ to win, but rolls a _5_, they move _3_ spaces to the win square, and backwards _2_.
